# Phobri64 Hardware

This repository contains the KiCad files for a custom motherboard for Hori Pad Mini controllers that uses hall effect sensors. It is based off the [PhobGCC](https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCCv2-HW) and is thus provided under the same license - CERN Open Hardware License Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal. Changes made to the Phob are expressed in CHANGES.txt, and changes to this board in any fork should also have such a file associated with it.

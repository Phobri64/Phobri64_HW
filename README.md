# Phobri64 Hardware

This repository contains the KiCad files for a custom motherboard for Hori Pad Mini controllers that uses hall effect sensors. It is based off the [PhobGCC](https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCCv2-HW) and is thus provided under the same license - CERN Open Hardware License Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal. Although we have diverged from the Phob design, all changes made starting with the prototype which was based off Phob are expressed in CHANGES.txt. Any changes to this design should carry a similar file.

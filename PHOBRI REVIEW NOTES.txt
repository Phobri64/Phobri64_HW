(X) I2C bus isolator perhaps at the connector (not doing)

(X) Doesn't really matter if the chassis pins are grounded or not.

(X) Orthogonal routing (did you learn anythign from 315)

(X) Pick the capacitor with the highest voltage rating possible for a given package size at a given capacitance value.


(X) Remove thermal reliefs on the holes under rp2040

(X) LDO needs more copper, exapnd the pour to the right
(X) and then do a local 3v3 pour on the bottom side to

(?) Sprinkle vias freely to tie the planes together
Put it near other vias to minimize return path


(X) Watch out for traces close to the edge, check with board constraints
(X) Should we put the ESD diode close to the edge too?? (yea, diff routing doesnt really work on inside and it would complicate 3d modeling + risky to expose any unecessary components)

(X) increase mounting hole sizes at exp pak [need mechanical testing again]

(X) Place flat test points for I2C on stick mobo

(X) Do we really need to have the grabbable test points? What would be the add to BOM cost? [No, went with flat ones, grabbable ones add like $3 to BOM.]

Test points add cost due to ENIG? Investigate removing them with JLC

(X) Touch up silkscreens

(X) Clean up footprints (make sure there is PCB/schematic parity by re-running update PCB from schematic at the very end)

(X) 3D model for button for next mechanical test?

(X) Fix that ugly looking 5V copper pour

(X) Clean up footprint library

What exactly do those randomly placed vias do?

SCH

(X) CC1 resistors for USBC

(X) Don't add the resistor to prevent overdrive.

(X) Put pullups at the loads not on the microcontroller

(X) Add some test points (3v3 GND I2C)

(X) Do differential measurement with the remaining two channels on the ADC. Tie to ground.

(X) SIZE I2C PULLUPS INTELLIGENTLY (ASK FOR HELP) [PROBABLY FINE, WENT WITH 1K]

Put pullups at the loads not on the microcontroller
I2C bus isolator perhaps at the connector
Orthogonal routing (did you learn anythign from 315)

Pick the capacitor with the highest voltage rating possible for a given package size at a given capacitance value.

Do differential measurement with the remaining two channels. Tie to ground.

Don't add the resistor to prevent overdrive.

Doesn't really matter if the chassis pins are grounded or not.

Remove thermal reliefs on the holes under the chip

LDO needs more copper, exapnd the pour to the right
and then do a local 3v3 pour on the bottom side to  

Sprinkle vias freely to tie the planes together
Put it near other vias to minimize return path

Add some test points (3v3 GND I2C)

Watch out for traces close to the edge, check with board constraints

(X) I2C bus isolator perhaps at the connector (not doing)

(X) Doesn't really matter if the chassis pins are grounded or not.

Orthogonal routing (did you learn anythign from 315)

Pick the capacitor with the highest voltage rating possible for a given package size at a given capacitance value.


Remove thermal reliefs on the holes under rp2040

LDO needs more copper, exapnd the pour to the right
and then do a local 3v3 pour on the bottom side to  

Sprinkle vias freely to tie the planes together
Put it near other vias to minimize return path


Watch out for traces close to the edge, check with board constraints
Should we put the ESD diode close to the edge too??



SCH

(X) CC1 resistors for USBC

(X) Don't add the resistor to prevent overdrive.

(X) Put pullups at the loads not on the microcontroller

(X) Add some test points (3v3 GND I2C)

(X) Do differential measurement with the remaining two channels on the ADC. Tie to ground.

SIZE I2C PULLUPS INTELLIGENTLY (ASK FOR HELP)
